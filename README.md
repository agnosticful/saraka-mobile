### Getting Started

#### Service Account Key

Check your debug key with keytool. As default, the keystore password is `android`.

```
keytool -list -v -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore
```

Input password. As default, the keystore password is `android`.

```
Enter keystore password: ðŸ”‘
```

Check the output and copy `SHA1` value. Here is the example output below:
