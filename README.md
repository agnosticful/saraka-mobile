## Development

### Getting Started

#### Service Account Key

Check your debug key with keytool. As default, the keystore password is `android`.

```
keytool -list -v -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore
```

Input password. As default, the keystore password is `android`.

```
Enter keystore password: ðŸ”‘
```

Check the output and copy `SHA1` value. Here is the example output below:

```
Alias name: androiddebugkey
Creation date: 30-Dec-2018
Entry type: PrivateKeyEntry
Certificate chain length: 1
Certificate[1]:

Certificate fingerprints:
	 MD5:  00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00
	 SHA1: 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:0:00
	 SHA256: 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00

```

Go to Firebase Console then go to App Setting -> "Saraka" (Android) (You can jump there by [this link](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/saraka/settings/general/android:app.axross.saraka)). Click the "Add fingerprint" button in the "SHA certificate fingerprints" section and paste your SHA1 value that you copied in the previous step there, then click "Save" button.

Click "google-services.json" to download the file.

Put the downloaded file as `<repository_root>/android/app/google-services.json`.

#### Android Signing Config

You need to receive a `key.properties` file from some exisiting member. This file is supposed to be placed at `android/key.properties`.

#### Generate a launcher icon

Run the command in the following to generate a launcher icon:

```
flutter packages pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main -f ./flutter_launcher_icons.yaml
```

### Debug Firebase Analytics

You can make sure whether Firebase Analytics events you attached to some action works correctly with DebugView. In order to use it, you need to enable Analytics Debug Mode with the following command:

```
adb shell setprop debug.firebase.analytics.app app.axross.saraka
```

_Note: Usually your machine has path to `adb`, but it doesn't if you installed Android SDK on Android Studio. In that case, you can find `adb` in `~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools` (macOS)._

If you want to disable it, you can do it with the following one:

```
adb shell setprop debug.firebase.analytics.app .none.
```
